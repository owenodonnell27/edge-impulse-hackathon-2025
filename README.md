## Development Process

### Data Collection

The data collection process consisted of driving to a local parking lot and taking images of a car in a spot as well as some empty spots. 134 images were taken total with 208 instances of open parking spaces and 107 instances of used parking spaces. Ideally these numbers should be closer in value. However, out of respect of not using random people's cars as part of the dataset, just personal vehicles were used. Example of image used for training:
